Lyrcs was made by songwriters, for songwriters.

Lyrcs' mission is to be a single tool that empowers you to do what you do best - tell stories through music. 

Here are the features it contains with more constantly in the works:

SYLLABLE COUNTING  
Have you ever needed to ensure a line in verse 2 matches the syllable count in verse 1? Gone are the days of manually counting on your fingers. Lyrcs provides instant syllable counting for every line in your lyrics.

DARK MODE SUPPORT  
Do you ever find your song writing process goes late into the night but a blinding white text editor ends your session early? You won't experience that problem with Lyrcs. Lyrcs detects that you have dark mode enabled on your system and switches to colors that are easy on the eye.

DYNAMIC FONT SIZE  
You may have written that great line but was it worth it if you spent the whole time squinting in pain? With Lyrcs that's a thing of the past. Just decrease/increase your font size using CMD,- or CMD,+ respectively.

SPELL CHECKING  
Ready to submit your Lyrics to the world wide web but worried you may have misspelled a word or two? Have Lyrcs do the hard work for you and immediately check for any spelling mistakes and suggest any corrections.
